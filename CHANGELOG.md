# Changelog

All notable changes to the skills in this repository.

Each skill is versioned independently in its own `Version:` line and its plugin manifest. A **major** bump means a breaking change to the conventions written into Octopad task descriptions (title prefixes, the continuation prompt shape, template section names), so plans written under the old version may need a checkpoint pass. Minor and patch bumps are safe to adopt as-is.

## octoplan

### 1.0.0 — 2026-07-28

First public release.

- Planning protocol for Octopad work streams: a planning session locks decisions with the user and writes every task as a complete, self-contained spec, verified against the real codebase or reference documents.
- Execution needs nothing installed: each task carries its own hand-off instruction, and a finishing session emits a one-line continuation prompt (`Octopad: <workspace> / <stream> #N - <task title>`) the user pastes into a fresh session.
- Execution order comes from real Octopad dependency edges plus a `#N - ` prefix in task titles.
- Parallel groups: exactly one sibling is the relay and emits the continuation; the others end silently, so the chain cannot fork.
- Multi-stream efforts: one goal, several work streams, one light Blueprint page explaining the global logic, and cross-stream dependencies enforcing it.
- Works for engineering and non-technical streams alike, with per-domain lenses for the interview and the specs.
